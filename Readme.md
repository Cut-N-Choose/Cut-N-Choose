# Cut-and-Choose strategy Solvers
Cut-and-Choose strategy solvers are for solving the optimal strategy for cut-and-choose games which have two challenges with different cost in secure computation.
There are three Cut-and-Choose strategy solvers here: MajorityCut solver, SingleCut solver and BatchedCut solver
#How to compile
Use $make to compile all;
Use $make MajorityCut to compile MajorityCut solver;
Use $make SingleCut to compile SingleCut solver;
Use $make BatchedCut to compile BatchedCut solver;

#How to run

Use ./MajorityCut to run MajorityCut solver;
Use ./SingleCut to run SingleCut solver;
Use ./BatchedCut to run BatchedCut solver;

#How to change parameters?

Edit test_MajorityCut.c to change the parameters for MajorityCut Solver;
Edit test_SingleCut.c to change the parameters for SingleCut Solver;
Edit test_BatchedCut.c to change the parameters for BatchedCut Solver;
